Imported numpy python library for numerical functions
imported pandas for making dataframes
imported scipy.stats library for statistics functions like probability etc
imported statsmodels.api python library for stats models
imported matplotlib.pyplot to plot charts
imported sklearn python library for linear models & others
Imported nltk for sentiment analysis
from sklearn.preprocessing imported PolynomialFeatures
Downloaded nltk english stopwords and the below modules as well:
"names","stopwords","state_union","twitter_samples","movie_reviews","averaged_perceptron_tagger","vader_lexicon","punkt",'shakespeare'

Seperated the Year_month column for year and month.
Filled the null values and 'missing' values of month & year with mod() of each respectively
Proceeded with 1-Hot encoding of object values except for reviewer text.
Performed sentiment analysis over reviewer text and received the sentiment values, which was appended in the data
Feature set taken (X)= Year,month,Park location,sentiment value
Target set taken (Y)= Rating

Taken polynomial function of X as X_poly

Trained different classification model for X_poly,Y and arrived at the xgBoost claasifier model with X polynomial degree=3
